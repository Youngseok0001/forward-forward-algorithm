# Implementaiton of "The Forward-Forward Algorithm: Some Preliminary Investigations"  

[Forward-forward algorithm](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/FFA13.pdf) (FFA) is a new training algorithm for feed-forward networks proposed by Geoffrey Hinton.

My implementation achieves test acc of 96% on MNIST after training for 100 epochs, which is 2~3% worse than the reported results.
